## 2025-05-24 - Consistent Copy Feedback
**Learning:** The application had inconsistent feedback for copy actions. `ShareDialog` provided "Copied!" feedback, while `Settings` (API key copy) used a toast only. To improving perceived performance and assurance, immediate button state change is preferred over just toast notifications.
**Action:** When implementing copy-to-clipboard functionality, always use the pattern: Change button text to "Copied!" and icon to "check" for 2 seconds, in addition to or instead of a toast.
