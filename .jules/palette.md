## 2024-05-22 - Sidebar Accessibility

**Learning:** Common pattern of `div` with `onClick` used for navigation/interactive elements instead of semantic `<button>` or `<a>` tags. This breaks keyboard accessibility and screen reader support.
**Action:** Always check interactive elements for semantic HTML tags. Replace `div` with `button` or `a` and ensure `type="button"` for non-submit buttons. Add `aria-label` where text is not descriptive enough, and `aria-current` for navigation links.

## 2024-05-23 - Material Symbols Screen Reader Accessibility

**Learning:** Material Symbols (using ligatures like `<span className="material-symbols-outlined">icon_name</span>`) are often announced literally by screen readers (e.g., "icon name") when used decoratively alongside text, creating redundant and confusing auditory experiences. Additionally, icons acting as loading spinners (`animate-spin`) lack proper container semantics to announce their state.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to Material Symbol `<span>` elements used decoratively alongside visible text. For icon-only loading states (spinners) and status indicators, ensure the parent container has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
## 2026-03-11 - Material Symbol Ligature Accessibility
**Learning:** Material Symbol icons implemented as text ligatures (e.g., <span ...>close</span>) require aria-hidden='true' to prevent screen readers from announcing the ligature text ('close').
**Action:** Always add aria-hidden='true' to ligature-based icon elements and ensure the parent interactive element has a descriptive aria-label.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Add Accessible Loading State to ActivityFeed
**Learning:** Icon-only loading states (like simple Material Symbol spinners) are completely invisible to screen readers unless explicitly given an accessible role and text. Also, declarative empty states using Material Symbols need to be hidden from screen readers to prevent redundant reading.
**Action:** Always wrap loading spinners in a `div` with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`, include `.sr-only` descriptive text inside it, and mark decorative ligature icons with `aria-hidden="true"`.
