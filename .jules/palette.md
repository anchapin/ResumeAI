## 2024-05-22 - Sidebar Accessibility

**Learning:** Common pattern of `div` with `onClick` used for navigation/interactive elements instead of semantic `<button>` or `<a>` tags. This breaks keyboard accessibility and screen reader support.
**Action:** Always check interactive elements for semantic HTML tags. Replace `div` with `button` or `a` and ensure `type="button"` for non-submit buttons. Add `aria-label` where text is not descriptive enough, and `aria-current` for navigation links.

## 2024-05-23 - Material Symbols Screen Reader Accessibility

**Learning:** Material Symbols (using ligatures like `<span className="material-symbols-outlined">icon_name</span>`) are often announced literally by screen readers (e.g., "icon name") when used decoratively alongside text, creating redundant and confusing auditory experiences. Additionally, icons acting as loading spinners (`animate-spin`) lack proper container semantics to announce their state.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to Material Symbol `<span>` elements used decoratively alongside visible text. For icon-only loading states (spinners) and status indicators, ensure the parent container has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
## 2026-03-11 - Material Symbol Ligature Accessibility
**Learning:** Material Symbol icons implemented as text ligatures (e.g., <span ...>close</span>) require aria-hidden='true' to prevent screen readers from announcing the ligature text ('close').
**Action:** Always add aria-hidden='true' to ligature-based icon elements and ensure the parent interactive element has a descriptive aria-label.
## 2026-03-11 - Material Symbol Ligature Screen Reader Noise
**Learning:** Even within an interactive element with a proper `aria-label`, the ligature text (e.g., "delete") of a Material Symbol `<span>` is sometimes still announced by certain screen readers, causing repetitive or confusing announcements.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to Material Symbol `<span>` elements acting as ligatures to strictly enforce their decorative status and let the parent interactive element handle the accessible name.
## 2026-03-17 - Material Symbol Loading Spinners in Buttons
**Learning:** Loading spinners implemented using Material Symbol ligatures (like 'progress_activity') inside buttons must be explicitly hidden from screen readers. If omitted, the screen reader repeatedly announces the ligature text ('progress activity') instead of just the button text, which creates an annoying and confusing experience.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to the loading spinner `<span>` and any decorative icons (`leftIcon`, `rightIcon`) inside accessible `<button>` components so the button handles its own accessible name.
